# üñ•Ô∏è Northumbria University Research Computing Community

## An afternoon talk from David Mytton, co-founder and CEO of Console 

We are pleased to announce that the NU Research Computing Community will be hosting David Mytton, Co-founder and CEO of [Console](https://console.dev/), for an afternoon talk on the **29th of April 2022**.

------

### Title: Software engineering tools, sustainability, and academia

Git, GitHub, pull requests, CI/CD, auto formatting and linting, static analysis, unit and integration tests, containers, serverless‚Ä¶these are all standard components in the software development lifecycle at tech companies of all sizes. In academia, you're lucky if you to use Git! This talk will run through a common software development tech toolkit and explain how these might be useful in research. And as many of these tools use cloud resources, and more research methodologies involve large scale computation and data analysis, we‚Äôll also consider the challenges of sustainable computing.

-------

David Mytton is in the relatively unusual position of having software engineering experience in both industry and academia. He is Co-founder & CEO of [Console](https://console.dev/), which launched early-2021 to provide the best tools for developers. He is also a researcher in sustainable computing affiliated with [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where he completed an Environmental Technology MSc in 2020. He worked on the sustainability research team at [Uptime Institute](https://uptimeinstitute.com/) between Dec 2020 and Nov 2021. From 2009-2018, David was Co-founder & CEO at [Server Density](https://www.serverdensity.com/), a London-based SaaS infrastructure monitoring startup. You can read more about his interests and background over at his website and blog: https://davidmytton.blog/about/.

*Note: For those who are free after the talk we would like to organise an informal event for discussion and networking - if you have any suggestions for this (venue, activities), please let us know!*

### ‚ùìWhat is the Northumbria University Research Computing Community?

This is a grassroots community being developed by a group of researchers at Northumbria. We recognise that many of us use similar tools, face similar problems, and teach similar topics - even if from different research domains. We hope that by meeting and sharing our experiences, our tips and tricks, our trials and successes, we will support and grow the research software community at Northumbria. If you are a staff member or PG student at Northumbria, join the Teams site "Research Computing Community" to find out more and meet other members.
